<h3>Caramel Milktea</h3>
<p> is a super delicious drink that is served hot or cold. It is made with tea, half and half, and a little sweetener. For this recipe caramel simple syrup is added to make it a rich Caramel Milk Tea. It can also have boba (tapioca pearls) in them, making it Boba Tea or Bubble Tea. They have no flavor on their own but when boiled and soaked in a simple syrup or tea they take on those flavors.</p>
<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
<p>4 if you choose to make boba with it, and 5 if you want to include the water as an ingredient.</P>
